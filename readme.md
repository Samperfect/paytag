# Paytag - The Building Story

SendCash is good! Really good! I mean, it's free, fast, and efficient for cross border money transfer. But something you start to realize about most crossborder solutions is that they tend not to focus on the locals. Sure, banks solve that but how great if crypto were to be so decentralized that I can just use it to make purchases at a local store?
But that still isn't the hit.

What if we could take it steps further by probing into the technology behind gift cards and tieing it up with cryto to allow for the local and cross border movement of money without necessarily needing to know the details of either the receiver or the sender?

During my 3 years of full-time online freelancing, I've had sceneries where I had to brainstorm with my clients on the best method to make payments to me. PayPal isn't directly supported in Nigeria those who have it leverage on the small market to deliver exchanges and way terrible rates. But that's not the case, almost every other option requires local bank involvement directly or indirectly and you money might sometimes spend weeks before getting to you.

And when I finally find a method that might work reasonably great, I would still have to go through the horrors of providing several information like address, postal code, name, email, and sometimes, Identity information talkless of the ones you would provide again when pickup the funds at the bank. The process, for me, just isn't so good!

And frustration came the birth of Paytag!

Paytag is a simple yet powerful and fluid payment and funds transfer system that allows for the crossborder movement and local spending of money such that funds do not necessarily have to be in-hand before purchases and payment of services can be made.
